We have no selfish ends to serve. We desire no conquest, no dominion. We seek no indemnities for ourselves, no material compensation for the sacrifices we shall freely make. We are but one of the champions of the rights of mankind. We shall be satisfied when those rights have been made as secure as the faith and the freedom of nations can make them.\\n\\nJust because we fight without rancor and without selfish object, seeking nothing for ourselves but what we shall wish to share with all free peoples, we shall, I feel confident, conduct our operations as belligerents without passion and ourselves observe with proud punctilio the principles of right and of fair play we profess to be fighting for.\\n\\n…\\n\\nIt will be all the easier for us to conduct ourselves as belligerents in a high spirit of right and fairness because we act without animus, not in enmity toward a people or with the desire to bring any injury or disadvantage upon them, but only in armed opposition to an irresponsible government which has thrown aside all considerations of humanity and of right and is running amuck. We are, let me say again, the sincere friends of the German people, and shall desire nothing so much as the early reestablishment of intimate relations of mutual advantage between us—however hard it may be for them, for the time being, to believe that this is spoken from our hearts.\\n\\nWe have borne with their present government through all these bitter months because of that friendship—exercising a patience and forbearance which would otherwise have been impossible. We shall, happily, still have an opportunity to prove that friendship in our daily attitude and actions toward the millions of men and women of German birth and native sympathy who live among us and share our life, and we shall be proud to prove it toward all who are in fact loyal to their neighbors and to the government in the hour of test. They are, most of them, as true and loyal Americans as if they had never known any other fealty or allegiance. They will be prompt to stand with us in rebuking and restraining the few who may be of a different mind and purpose. If there should be disloyalty, it will be dealt with with a firm hand of stern repression; but, if it lifts its head at all, it will lift it only here and there and without countenance except from a lawless and malignant few.\\n\\nIt is a distressing and oppressive duty, gentlemen of the Congress, which I have performed in thus addressing you. There are, it may be, many months of fiery trial and sacrifice ahead of us. It is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war, into the most terrible and disastrous of all wars, civilization itself seeming to be in the balance. But the right is more precious than peace, and we shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts—for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own governments, for the rights and liberties of small nations, for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world itself at last free.\\n\\nTo such a task we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes, everything that we are and everything that we have, with the pride of those who know that the day has come when America is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles that gave her birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured. God helping her, she can do no other.')]"

PolicyContentsArrow DownOverviewSymptoms and CausesDiagnosis and TestsManagement and TreatmentOutlook / PrognosisPreventionLiving WithAdditional Common QuestionsContentsArrow DownOverviewSymptoms and CausesDiagnosis and TestsManagement and TreatmentOutlook / PrognosisPreventionLiving WithAdditional Common QuestionsOverviewDyslexia can disrupt reading ability in multiple ways. It's common for children who have it to feel anxious about reading in front others or try to avoid it altogether.What is dyslexia?Dyslexia is a\\xa0learning disability that makes reading and language-related tasks harder. It happens because of disruptions in how your\\xa0brain processes writing so you can understand it. Most people learn they have dyslexia during childhood, and it’s typically a lifelong issue. This form of dyslexia is also known as “developmental dyslexia.”AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. PolicyDyslexia falls under the umbrella of “specific learning disorder.” That disorder has three main subtypes:Reading (dyslexia).Writing (dysgraphia).Math (dyscalculia).How dyslexia\\xa0affects\\xa0language understandingReading starts with spoken language. In early childhood, speaking starts with making simple sounds. As you learn more sounds, you also learn how to use sounds to form words, phrases and sentences. Learning to read involves connecting sounds to different written symbols (letters).This is where dyslexia enters the picture. It interferes with how your brain uses spoken language to “decode” writing. Your brain has trouble processing what you read, especially breaking words into sounds or relating letters to sounds when reading.That slowdown in processing can affect everything that follows. That includes:Slowed reading because you have trouble\\xa0processing and understanding\\xa0words.Difficulties with writing and spelling.Problems with how you store words and their meanings in your memory.Trouble forming sentences to communicate more complex ideas.How common is dyslexia?Dyslexia is uncommon overall but widespread enough to be well-known. Experts estimate it affects about 7% of people worldwide. It affects people equally regardless of sex and race.However, many people have symptoms that aren’t severe enough for diagnosis. Including people with symptoms but without a diagnosis, dyslexia may affect up to 20% of people worldwide.AdvertisementSymptoms and CausesWhat causes dyslexia?The exact cause of dyslexia isn’t clear. However, several clues hint at how and why most cases happen.Genetics. Dyslexia is highly genetic and runs in families. A child with one parent with dyslexia has a 30% to 50% chance of inheriting it. Genetic conditions like Down syndrome can also make dyslexia more likely to happen.Differences in brain development and function. If you have dyslexia, you’re neurodivergent. That means your brain formed or works differently than expected. Research shows people with dyslexia have differences in brain structure, function and chemistry.Disruptions in brain development and function. Infections, toxic exposures and other events can disrupt fetal development and increase the odds of later development of dyslexia.Risk factorsSeveral risk factors can contribute to whether someone develops dyslexia. They include (but aren’t limited to):Toxic exposures. Toxins in the air and water can increase your risk of developing dyslexia. This is especially true with heavy metals (like lead or manganese), nicotine and certain chemicals used as flame retardants.Lack of access to reading material. The risk of developing dyslexia is higher for children who grow up in households where reading isn’t encouraged or where reading material is less available.Learning environment limitations. Children with less learning support in school or similar environments are more likely to develop dyslexia.What are the signs and symptoms of dyslexia?As a child gets older, dyslexia can often look like:Difficulty spelling simple words.Trouble learning the names of letters.Problems telling apart letters with similar shapes, such as “d” and “b” or “p” and “q.”Trouble rhyming.Reluctance to read aloud in class.Trouble sounding out new words.Trouble associating sounds with letters or parts of words.Trouble learning how sounds go together.Mixing up the position of sounds in a word.Having one of the above doesn’t mean a person has dyslexia, but if they’re having trouble learning the basic skills for reading, then dyslexia screening and testing is a good way to see if they need specialized help.Dyslexia also has levels of severity:Mild: Difficulties are there, but you can compensate or work around them with the right accommodations or support.Moderate: Difficulties are significant enough that you need specialized instructions and help. You may also need specific interventions or accommodations.Severe: Difficulties are so pronounced that they continue to be a problem even with specialized interventions, accommodations and other forms of treatment.Diagnosis and TestsAllison Poore, CCC-SLP, explains what dyslexia is and how it’s diagnosed.How is dyslexia diagnosed?Although dyslexia is due to differences in your brain, no blood tests or lab screenings can detect it. Instead, careful evaluation and testing of common signs identify someone with this reading problem.AdvertisementTesting for dyslexia should look at:Decoding (reading unfamiliar words by sounding them out).Oral language skills.Reading fluency and reading comprehension.Spelling.Vocabulary.Word recognition.When should I have my child tested for dyslexia?Typically, early testing is best for learning disabilities. Your child can begin learning new reading strategies sooner with an early diagnosis. Many children show reading problems before third grade, but the reading demands increase with age, and it’s important to diagnose any learning disorder as early as possible.Your child’s school may recommend an evaluation for learning disabilities with a certified educational psychologist. Ask the school administration for help finding one available to you.Management and TreatmentWhat treatment options exist for dyslexia?Currently, no medications treat dyslexia. Instead, educational interventions can teach effective new ways to learn and read.Children with dyslexia may work with a trained specialist to learn new reading skills. Sometimes, slowing down a lesson gives a child with dyslexia more time to cover topics. Work with your child’s school to ensure your child gets the education they deserve.How can I help my child with dyslexia?The most important thing you can do is to spend time reading aloud with your child. That time spent together can help them as they work on their reading skills.AdvertisementIt’s also important to remember that dyslexia isn’t something that your child has control over. Be patient and supportive. The encouragement and backing you provide can be the boost your child needs as they learn to manage their dyslexia. It can also help them feel less anxious or afraid about reading-related activities.You can also be an advocate for your child. You and your child’s school can develop an Individualized Education Plan (called an IEP). This document sets personalized expectations and lesson plans for your child at school.Is dyslexia in adults treatable?Yes, adults can benefit from treatment for dyslexia. There are programs and tools available that can help you with dyslexia-related reading difficulties no matter your age.Outlook / PrognosisWhat is the outlook for dyslexia?Dyslexia often draws attention when children begin learning to read, but it isn’t always detected early. Without early diagnosis, many children struggle with reading problems throughout school and into adulthood.When dyslexia remains undiagnosed, children struggle to succeed in school. Identifying dyslexia by second grade gives children more time to find different ways to learn and read.Misconceptions about dyslexia have led some to believe that people with dyslexia aren’t smart. Although untrue, this assumption can have negative effects on children.AdvertisementA child with dyslexia may suffer self-esteem issues or believe they aren’t intelligent. They also have a higher risk of developing mental health conditions like anxiety or depression. Positive support from parents and teachers can help a child overcome these obstacles.PreventionHow can I prevent dyslexia?Dyslexia isn’t preventable, but it’s often manageable with different strategies for learning and reading. You should:Talk with a healthcare provider if you notice any early signs of dyslexia.Work with your child’s school to develop an individualized education plan.Support your child’s mental health, too, and consider mental health care if your child experiences anxiety or other issues related to their dyslexia.Living WithWhat does living with dyslexia mean?A common misconception is that dyslexia is a disease. Another misconception is that a person with dyslexia is less intelligent. Both of these ideas are false. In fact, research shows no link between intelligence and dyslexia. Many people with dyslexia go on to achieve highly in their fields of choice.Having dyslexia means reading is hard for you, not that you’re incapable or lazy. Finding techniques to help manage dyslexia is critical to successful learning and self-esteem. Understand that having dyslexia doesn’t reflect poor intelligence.Can you still be successful if you have dyslexia?Yes. While dyslexia presents challenges for many who have it, there’s no shortage of high-achievers with dyslexia. Some examples of famous or very successful people with dyslexia include:Jennifer Anniston (actor, producer).Richard Branson (entrepreneur, businessperson and philanthropist).Cher (singer).Anderson Cooper (journalist).Tom Cruise (actor).Amanda Gorman (poet).Selma Hayek (actor, director).Tom Holland (actor).Earvin “Magic” Johnson (athlete).Keanu Reeves (actor, philanthropist, publisher).Octavia Spencer (actor, author)Steven Spielberg (director).Tim Tebow (athlete).Henry Winkler (actor).Additional Common QuestionsIs dyslexia a form of autism?No, dyslexia and autism are separate conditions. Autism spectrum disorder and specific learning disorder (including dyslexia and the other two subtypes) all fall under neurodevelopmental disorders. But they aren’t the same thing. You can have both at once, but having them at the same time doesn’t mean one causes the other.Similarly, dyslexia and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are also separate conditions. Like autism, ADHD is in the same class as specific learning disorder, and you can also have both ADHD and dyslexia at the same time. However, they’re also independent of each other, meaning having both doesn’t mean one caused the other.Is dyslexia always a learning disability?No, dyslexia isn’t always a learning disability. While developmental dyslexia (the learning disability form) is the most common type, another type is possible but much less common.Acquired dyslexia is a form that can develop later in life. It’s almost always due to another medical event or condition. Damage to your brain can disrupt processes like reading. It’s most common with damage from a stroke, head injury or other illness that can injure your brain.Is dyslexia a visual problem that causes letters to appear flipped or rotated?Sometimes, but not always. Dyslexia is a condition that can affect your perception of letters and writing. However, not everyone experiences the exact same symptoms of dyslexia.A note from Cleveland ClinicHaving dyslexia can be frustrating or embarrassing at any age. For children, it can be a major source of fear or anxiety, especially if they don’t know why they struggle to do something that others don’t have trouble with. If you or your child has dyslexia, it’s important to remember that it’s a widespread condition. It’s also not a sign that you’re less intelligent, unmotivated or lazy. It’s a difference in how your brain works. It creates challenges for you but doesn’t have to stand between you and your goals.If your child’s teacher suspects your child has dyslexia, you can get help. Talk to your child’s healthcare provider, teacher or their school administrators and specialists to learn more about how you can help your child manage and even overcome their dyslexia.Medically ReviewedLast reviewed on 04/11/2023.Learn more about the Health Library and our editorial process.ReferencesAdvertisementAdvertisementAdAppointments 866.588.2264Appointments & LocationsRequest an AppointmentRendered: Wed Jul 16 2025 12:24:42 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)FacebookXYouTubeInstagramLinkedInPinterestSnapchatActionsAppointments & AccessAccepted InsuranceEvents CalendarFinancial AssistanceGive to Cleveland ClinicPay Your Bill OnlineRefer a PatientPhone DirectoryVirtual Second OpinionsVirtual VisitsBlog, News & AppsConsult QDHealth EssentialsNewsroomMyClevelandClinicMyChartAbout Cleveland Clinic100 Years of Cleveland ClinicAbout UsLocationsQuality & Patient SafetyPatient ExperienceResearch & InnovationsCommunity CommitmentCareersFor EmployeesResources for Medical ProfessionalsSite Information & PoliciesSend Us FeedbackSite MapAbout this WebsiteCopyright, Reprint & LicensingWebsite Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyNotice of Privacy PracticesNon-Discrimination and Availability9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 800.223.2273 | © 2025 Cleveland Clinic.

It is characterized by difficulties with \\naccurate and/or fluent word recognition and by poor spelling and decoding abilities. These difficulties typically \\nresult from a deficit in the phonological component of language that is often unexpected in relation to other \\ncognitive abilities and the provision of effective classroom instruction. Secondary consequences may include \\nproblems in reading comprehension and reduced reading experience that can impede the growth of vocabulary \\nand background knowledge. \\nBut what does that mean exactly? \\nDyslexia is a language-based learning disability. Dyslexia refers to a cluster of symptoms, which result in people having \\ndifficulties with specific language skills, particularly reading. Students with dyslexia usually experience difficulties with \\nother language skills, such as spelling, writing, and pronouncing words. Dyslexia affects individuals throughout their \\nlives; however, its impact can change at different stages in a person’s life. It is referred to as a learning disability \\nbecause dyslexia can make it very difficult for a student to succeed academically in the typical instructional \\nenvironment, and in its more severe forms, will qualify a student for special education, special accommodations, and/\\nor extra support services.  \\nWhat causes dyslexia?  \\nThe exact causes of dyslexia are still not completely clear, but anatomical and brain imagery studies show differences in \\nthe way the brain of a person with dyslexia develops and functions. Moreover, most people with dyslexia have been \\nfound to have problems with identifying the separate speech sounds within a word and/or learning how letters \\nrepresent those sounds, a key factor in their reading difficulties. Dyslexia is not due to either lack of intelligence or \\ndesire to learn; with appropriate teaching methods, students with dyslexia can learn successfully. \\nDyslexia occurs in people of all backgrounds and intellectual levels. People with dyslexia can be very bright. They are \\noften capable or even gifted in areas such as art, computer science, design, drama, electronics, math, mechanics, \\nmusic, physics, sales, and sports. In addition, dyslexia runs in families; having a parent or sibling with dyslexia increases \\nthe probability that you will also have dyslexia.  For some people, their dyslexia is identified early in their lives, but for \\nothers, their dyslexia goes unidentified until they get older.  \\nWhat are the effects of dyslexia?  \\nThe impact that dyslexia has is different for each person and depends on the severity of the condition and the \\ntimeliness and effectiveness of instruction or remediation. The core difficulty involves word recognition and reading \\nfluency, spelling, and writing. Some individuals with dyslexia manage to learn early reading and spelling tasks, \\nespecially with excellent instruction, but later experience their most debilitating problems when more complex \\nlanguage skills are required, such as grammar, understanding textbook material, and writing essays.  \\nPeople with dyslexia can also have problems with spoken language, even after they have been exposed to excellent \\nlanguage models in their homes and high quality language instruction in school.

Such language problems are often \\ndifficult to recognize, but they can lead to major problems in school, in the workplace, and in relating to other people. \\nThe effects of dyslexia reach well beyond the classroom.  \\nWhat misconceptions exist regarding dyslexia?  \\nIt is equally important to understand what dyslexia isn’t.  There are great misconceptions and myths about dyslexia \\nwhich make it that much more difficult for someone with dyslexia to receive help and generally be understood. \\nIt is a myth that individuals with dyslexia “read backwards.” Their spelling can look quite jumbled at times not because \\nthey read or see words backwards, but because students have trouble remembering letter symbols for sounds and \\nletter patterns in words.  \\nDyslexia is not a disease and, therefore, there is no cure. With proper diagnosis, appropriate and timely instruction, \\nhard work, and support from family, teachers, friends, and others, individuals who have dyslexia can succeed in school \\nand later as adults. \\nIndividuals with dyslexia do not have a lower level of intelligence.  In fact, more often than not, the complete opposite \\nis true.  \\nSIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF DYSLEXIA \\nIt is crucial to be able to recognize the signs of symptoms of dyslexia.  The earlier a child is evaluated, the sooner he or \\nshe can obtain the appropriate instruction and accommodations he or she needs to succeed in school.   \\nGeneral problems experienced by people with dyslexia include the following:  \\n\\uf0b7 Learning to speak  \\n\\uf0b7 Learning letters and their sounds  \\n\\uf0b7 Organizing written and spoken language  \\n\\uf0b7 Memorizing number facts  \\n\\uf0b7 Reading quickly enough to comprehend  \\n\\uf0b7 Keeping up with and comprehending longer reading assignments  \\n\\uf0b7 Spelling  \\n\\uf0b7 Learning a foreign language  \\n\\uf0b7 Correctly doing math operations \\nSome specific signs for elementary aged children may include: \\n\\uf0b7 Difficulty with remembering simple sequences such as counting to 20, naming the days of the week, or \\nreciting the alphabet \\n\\uf0b7 Difficulty understanding the rhyming of words, such as knowing that fat rhymes with cat \\n\\uf0b7 Trouble recognizing words that begin with the same sound (for example, that bird, baby”, and big all start \\nwith b) \\n\\uf0b7 Pronunciation difficulties \\n4'),\n",

Although disabilities \\nmay co-occur, one is not the cause of the other.  \\nSOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL CONNECTION \\nSamuel T. Orton, M.D., was one of the first researchers to describe the emotional aspects of dyslexia. According to his \\nresearch, the majority of preschoolers who were later diagnosed as having dyslexia are happy and well adjusted.

Schultz’s informative IDA fact sheet “The Dyslexia-Stress-Anxiety Connection” is a must read for those \\nwanting guidance on understanding the relationship between dyslexia and emotional and social difficulties, as well as \\nthe implications for academic performance and social interactions. Dr. Schultz explains his DE-STRESS model in a step-\\nby-step guide for addressing stress, anxiety, and dyslexia. \\nStress and anxiety increase when we’re in situations over which we have little or no control (e.g., a car going off \\nthe road, tripping on the stairs, reading in public). All people, young and old, can experience overwhelming \\nstress and exhibit signs of anxiety, but children, adolescents, and adults with dyslexia are particularly \\nvulnerable. That’s because many individuals do not fully understand the nature of their learning disability, and \\nas a result, tend to blame themselves for their own difficulties. Years of self-doubt and self-recrimination may \\nerode a person’s self-esteem, making them less able to tolerate the challenges of school, work, or social \\ninteractions and more stressed and anxious.  \\nMany individuals with dyslexia have experienced years of frustration and limited success, despite countless \\nhours spent in special programs or working with specialists. Their progress may have been agonizingly slow and \\nfrustrating, rendering them emotionally fragile and vulnerable. Some have been subjected to excessive \\npressure to succeed (or excel) without the proper support or training. Others have been continuously \\ncompared to siblings, classmates, or co-workers, making them embarrassed, cautious, and defensive. \\nIndividuals with dyslexia may have learned that being in the company of others places them at risk for making \\npublic mistakes and the inevitable negative reactions that may ensue.

Students with dyslexia often end up feeling “dumb” and less capable \\nthan they actually are. After experiencing a great deal of stress due to academic problems, a student may become \\ndiscouraged about continuing in school. \\nIf children succeed in school, they will develop positive feelings about themselves and believe that they can succeed in \\nlife. If children meet failure and frustration, they learn that they are inferior to others, and that their effort makes very \\nlittle difference. Instead of feeling powerful and productive, they learn that their environment controls them. They feel \\npowerless and incompetent.  \\nResearchers have learned that when typical learners succeed, they credit their own efforts for their success. When they \\nfail, they tell themselves to try harder. However, when learners with dyslexia succeed, they are likely to attribute their \\nsuccess to luck. When they fail, they simply see themselves as stupid.  \\nResearch also suggests that these feelings of inferiority develop by the age of 10. After this age, it becomes extremely \\ndifficult to help the child develop a positive self-image. This is a powerful argument for early intervention. \\nDepression \\nDepression is also a frequent complication in dyslexia. Depressed children and adolescents often have different \\nsymptoms than do depressed adults. The depressed child is unlikely to be lethargic or to talk about feeling sad. Instead \\nhe or she may become more active or misbehave to cover up the painful feelings. In the case of masked depression, \\nthe child may not seem obviously unhappy. However, both children and adults who are depressed tend to have three \\nsimilar characteristics: \\n\\uf0b7 They tend to have negative thoughts about themselves, that is, a negative self- image. \\n\\uf0b7 They tend to view the world negatively. They are less likely to enjoy the positive experiences in life. This \\nmakes it difficult for them to have fun.  \\n\\uf0b7 Most depressed youngsters have great trouble imagining anything positive about the future. The \\ndepressed child with dyslexia not only experiences great pain in his present experiences, but also foresees \\na life of continuing failure.  \\nSo how can you help? \\nChildren are more successful when early in their lives someone has been extremely supportive and encouraging, and \\nwhen they have found an area in which they can succeed. Teachers can create an incredible support system by: \\n\\uf0b7 Listening to children’s feelings. Anxiety, anger and depression can be daily companions for children with \\ndyslexia. However, their language problems often make it difficult for them to express their feelings. \\nTherefore, adults must help them learn to talk about their feelings.   \\n\\uf0b7 Rewarding effort, not just “the product.” For students with dyslexia, grades should be less important than \\nprogress.   \\n6'),\n",

For \\nexample, a student with dyslexia can be given extra time to complete tasks, help with taking notes, and work \\nassignments that are modified appropriately. Teachers can give taped tests or allow students with dyslexia to use \\nalternative means of assessment. Students can benefit from listening to books on tape and using text reading and word \\nprocessing computer programs.  \\nTeaching students with dyslexia across settings is challenging.  Both general education and special education teachers \\nseek accommodations that foster the learning and management of a class of heterogeneous learners.  It is important to \\nidentify accommodations that are reasonable to ask of teachers in all classroom settings.  The following \\naccommodations provide a framework for helping students with learning problems achieve in general education and \\nspecial education classrooms.  They are organized according to accommodations involving materials, interactive \\ninstruction, and student performance. \\nAccommodations Involving Materials \\nStudents spend a large portion of the school day interacting with materials.  Most instructional materials give teachers \\nfew activities or directions for teaching a large class of students who learn at different rates and in various ways.  This \\nsection provides material accommodations that enhance the learning of diverse students.  Frequently, \\nparaprofessionals, volunteers, and students can help develop and implement various accommodations.  Material \\naccommodations include the following: \\n\\uf0b7 Clarify or simplify written directions.  Some directions are written in paragraph form and contain many \\nunits of information. These can be overwhelming to some students.  The teacher can help by underlining or \\nhighlighting the significant parts of the directions.  Rewriting the directions is often helpful.   \\n\\uf0b7 Present a small amount of work.  The teacher can tear pages from workbooks and materials to present \\nsmall assignments to students who are anxious about the amount of work to be done.  This technique \\nprevents students from examining an entire workbook, text, or material and becoming discouraged by the \\namount of work.   \\nCLASSROOM STRATEGIES, TIPS AND TOOLS \\n\\uf0b7 When confronting unacceptable behavior, do not inadvertently discourage the child with dyslexia. Words \\nsuch as “lazy” or “incorrigible” can seriously damage the child’s self-image.   \\n\\uf0b7 Helping students set realistic goals for themselves. Many students with dyslexia set perfectionistic and \\nunattainable goals. By helping the child set an attainable goal, teachers can change the cycle of failure.   \\nAbove all, it is critical that school personnel, parents, and outside professionals working with the child with dyslexia \\ncommunicate on an on-going basis to provide the support needed, so he or she can become a happy and successful \\nstudent, and eventually, a happy and successful adult. \\n7'),\n",

If a student is easily distracted by visual stimuli on a full worksheet or page, \\na blank sheet of paper can be used to cover sections of the page not being worked on at the time.  Also, \\nline markers can be used to aid reading, and windows can be used to display individual math problems. \\nAdditionally, using larger font sizes and increasing spacing can help separate sections. \\n\\uf0b7 Highlight essential information.  If an adolescent can read a regular textbook but has difficulty finding the \\nessential information, the teacher can mark this information with a highlight pen. \\n\\uf0b7 Use a placeholder in consumable material.  In consumable materials in which students progress \\nsequentially (such as workbooks), the student can make a diagonal cut across the lower right-hand corner \\nof the pages as they are completed.  With all the completed pages cut, the student and teacher can readily \\nlocate the next page that needs to be corrected or completed. \\n\\uf0b7 Provide additional practice activities.  Some materials do not provide enough practice activities for \\nstudents with learning problems to acquire mastery on selected skills.  Teachers then must supplement the \\nmaterial with practice activities.  Recommended practice exercises include instructional games, peer \\nteaching activities, self-correcting materials, computer software programs, and additional worksheets. \\n\\uf0b7 Provide a glossary in content areas.  Students often benefit from a glossary of content-related terms. \\n\\uf0b7 Develop reading guides.  A reading guide helps the reader understand the main ideas and sort out the \\nnumerous details related to the main ideas.  A reading guide can be developed paragraph-by-paragraph, \\npage-by-page, or section-by-section. \\n\\uf0b7 Use an audio recording device.  Directions, stories, and specific lessons can be recorded.  The student can \\nreplay the tape to clarify understanding of directions or concepts.

Assistive technology products such as tablets, electronic readers/dictionaries/\\nspellers, text to speech programs, audio books, and more can be very useful tools. \\nAccommodations Involving Interactive Instruction \\nThe task of gaining students’ attention and engaging them for a period of time requires many teaching and managing \\nskills.

Some \\naccommodations to enhance successful interactive instructional activities are: \\n\\uf0b7 Use explicit teaching procedures.  Many commercial materials do not cue teachers to use explicit teaching \\nprocedures; thus, the teacher often must adapt a material to include these procedures.  Teachers can \\ninclude explicit teaching steps within their lessons (i.e., present an advanced organizer, demonstrate the \\nskill, provide guided practice, offer corrective feedback, set up independent practice, monitor practice, and \\nreview). \\n\\uf0b7 Repeat directions.  Students who have difficulty following directions are often helped by asking them to \\nrepeat the directions in their own words.  The student can repeat the directions to a peer when the teacher \\nis unavailable. If directions contain several steps, break down the directions into subsets.

Most \\npeople with dyslexia need help from a teacher, tutor, or therapist specially trained in a structured literacy approach. \\nMany individuals with dyslexia need one-on-one help so that they can move forward at their own pace. In addition, \\nstudents with dyslexia often need a great deal of structured practice and immediate, corrective feedback to develop \\nautomatic word recognition skills. For students with dyslexia, it is helpful if their outside academic therapists work \\nclosely with classroom teachers.  \\nWhat is a Structured Literacy approach? \\nStructured Literacy instruction is marked by several elements: \\nPhonology. Phonology is the study of sound structure of spoken words and is a critical element of Structured \\nLanguage instruction. Phonological awareness includes rhyming, counting words in spoken sentence, and clapping \\nsyllables in spoken words. An important aspect of phonological awareness is phonemic awareness or the ability to \\nsegment words into their component sounds, which are called phonemes. A phoneme is the smallest unit of sound in a \\ngiven language that can be recognized as being distinct from other sounds in the language. For example, the \\nword cap has three phonemes (/k/, /ă/, /p/), and the word clasp has five phonemes (/k/, /l/, /ă/, /s/, /p/). \\nSound-Symbol Association. Once students have developed the awareness of phonemes of spoken language, they must \\nlearn how to map the phonemes to symbols or printed letters. Sound-symbol association must be taught and mastered \\nin two directions: visual to auditory (reading) and auditory to visual (spelling). Additionally, students must master the \\nblending of sounds and letters into words as well as the segmenting of whole words into the individual sounds. The \\ninstruction of sound-symbol associations is often referred to as phonics. Although phonics is a component of Structured \\nLiteracy, it is embedded within a rich and deep language context. \\nSyllable Instruction. A syllable is a unit of oral or written language with one vowel sound. Instruction includes teaching \\nof the six basic syllable types in the English language: closed, vowel-consonant-e, open, consonant-le, r-controlled, and \\nvowel pair. Knowledge of syllable types is an important organizing idea. By knowing the syllable type, the reader can \\nbetter determine the sound of the vowel in the syllable. Syllable division rules heighten the reader’s awareness of \\nwhere a long, unfamiliar word may be divided for great accuracy in reading the word. \\nMorphology. A morpheme is the smallest unit of meaning in the language. The Structured Literacy curriculum includes \\nthe study of base words, roots, prefixes, and suffixes. The word instructor, for example, is contains the root struct, \\nwhich means to build, the prefix in, which means in or into, and the suffix or, which means one who. An instructor is \\none who builds knowledge in his or her students. \\nSyntax. Syntax is the set of principles that dictate the sequence and function of words in a sentence in order to convey \\nmeaning. This includes grammar, sentence variation, and the mechanics of language. \\nSemantics. Semantics is that aspect of language concerned with meaning. The curriculum (from the beginning) must \\ninclude instruction in the comprehension of written language. \\nStructured Literacy is distinctive in the principles that guide how critical elements are taught: \\nSystematic and Cumulative. Structured Literacy instruction is systematic and cumulative. Systematic means that the \\norganization of material follows the logical order of the language. The sequence must begin with the easiest and most \\nbasic concepts and elements and progress methodically to more difficult concepts and elements. Cumulative means \\neach step must be based on concepts previously learned. \\n11'),\n",

Structured Literacy instruction requires the deliberate teaching of all concepts with continuous \\nstudent-teacher interaction. It is not assumed that students will naturally deduce these concepts on their own. \\nDiagnostic Teaching. The teacher must be adept at individualized instruction. That is instruction that meets a student’s \\nneeds. The instruction is based on careful and continuous assessment, both informally (for example, observation) and \\nformally (for example, with standardized measures. The content presented must be mastered to the degree of \\nautomaticity. Automaticity is critical to freeing all the student’s attention and cognitive resources for comprehension \\nand expression. \\nSCREENING, EVALUATION, AND DIAGNOSIS \\nEarly identification and intervention with students who show the warning signs of dyslexia are critically important for \\nbetter outcomes later on. Researchers have identified the specific skill weaknesses that predict later reading \\ndifficulties, making early testing, identification, and remediation possible. For most children, problems can be \\nremediated with programs at the kindergarten and first-grade levels that take about 30-45 minutes per day. \\nBefore second grade, it is more important to focus an evaluation on the precursors of reading development. Measures \\nof language skills, phonological awareness, memory, and rapid naming are more suggestive of being at-risk for dyslexia \\namong young children than are measures of word reading, decoding, and spelling. Therefore, measures of phonological \\nawareness, memory, and rapid naming are typically included in Kindergarten and beginning first grade screening tests \\nthat can identify children who need targeted intervention to improve these critical skills so these children can meet \\ngrade- level benchmarks. \\nHow is dyslexia diagnosed?  \\nA comprehensive evaluation typically includes intellectual and academic achievement testing, as well as an assessment \\nof the critical underlying language skills that are closely linked to dyslexia. These include receptive (listening) and \\nexpressive language skills, phonological skills including phonemic awareness, and also a student’s ability to rapidly \\nname letters and names. A student’s ability to read lists of words in isolation, as well as words in context, should also \\nbe assessed. If a profile emerges that is characteristic of readers with dyslexia, an individualized intervention plan \\nshould be developed, which should include appropriate accommodations, such as extended time. The testing can be \\nconducted by trained school or outside specialists. \\nWhy is evaluation important?  \\nAn evaluation is the process of gathering information to identify the factors contributing to a student’s difficulty with \\nlearning to read and spell. First, information is gathered from parents and teachers to understand development and \\nthe educational opportunities that have been provided. Then, tests are given to identify strengths and weaknesses that \\nlead to a diagnosis and a tentative road map for intervention. Conclusions and recommendations are developed and \\nreported.  \\nWhen should a child be evaluated? \\nIt is possible to identify potential reading problems in young children even before the problems turn into reading \\nfailure.
